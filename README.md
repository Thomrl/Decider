# Merge - Read this if you use this
I have chosen to merge this repository and the original Random-Decider repository I made to begin with.

I wasnt sure of how to use github to begin with and this has made it a little confusing.

The original repository/project can be found here: https://github.com/Thomrl/Random

The original webapp which have been "upgraded" can be found here: https://thomrl.github.io/Random/
